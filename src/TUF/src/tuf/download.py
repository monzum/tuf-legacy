<Purpose>
  Perform any file downloads and check their validity.  This means that the
  hash and length of a downloaded file has to match the hash and length
  supplied by the metadata of that file.  The downloaded file is technically a 
  file-like object that will automatically destroys itself once closed.  Note
  that the file-like object, 'tuf.util.TempFile', is returned by the
  'download_url_to_tempfileobj()' function.

      A dictionary with hash-algorithm names as keys and hashes as dict values.

    Given the url, hashes and length of the desired file, this function 
    opens a connection to 'url' and downloads the file while ensuring its
    length and hashes match 'required_hashes' and 'required_length'. 
 
    tuf.util.TempFile is used instead of regular tempfile object because of

      A url string that represents the location of the file. 
  
    required_hashes:
      A dictionary, where the keys represent the hashing algorithm used to 
      hash the file and the dict values the hexdigest.
  
      For instance, a hash pair might look something like this:
      {'md5': '37544f383be1fc1a32f42801c9c4b4d6'}
  
    required_length:
      An integer value representing the length of the file.
  
  <Side Effects>
    'tuf.util.TempFile' object is created.
 
  <Exceptions>
    tuf.DownloadError, if there was an error while downloading the file.
