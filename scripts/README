Server
	-To run the server run the following from within the server dir:
         
         python src/server.py

         This serves all the files in the src director on port 8000

        -When files on the server are updated
         run:
       
         python make_manifest.py()	

         This will update the manifest file with the appropriate hashes,
         the manifest file is also contained in the src dir
