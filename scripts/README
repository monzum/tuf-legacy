Server
	-To run the server run the following from within the server dir:
         
         python src/server.py

         This serves all the files in the src director on port 8000

        -When files on the server are updated
         run:
       
         python make_manifest.py()	

         This will update the manifest file with the appropriate hashes,
         the manifest file is also contained in the src dir

Mirrors
     
      -Mirrors each have their own server to run for each mirror,
     
       python mirror#/src/server.py
 
       where # is replaced by the mirror#
       currently working on a script to automate serving all mirrors
 
      -On the client side, there is a script get_files.py
       this is intended to be used to get the manifest file from the server,
       and fetch files if the manifest has changed since the last time
       it was pulled from the server.  Currently, files are not fetched
       but the manifest file is correctly retrieved and checked,
       in the future we need to automate polling the serving regularly
       with this script

       python get_files.py <server dest>

       in our case,

       python get_files.py 127.0.0.1:8000
